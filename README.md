Other notes:
- [Auto-updates with new data each month](#auto-update)
- [Powered by cleaned, public data (derived from the official Citibike data)](#cleaned-data)
- Interactive! Filter/Stack by:
  - user type (annual "subscriber" vs. daily "customer")
  - gender (male, female, other/unspecified; historical data up to Feb 2021 only)
  - region (NYC and/or JC)
  - date range (at monthly granularity, back to system launch in June 2013)
- URL syncs with plot controls, for ease of linking to specific views, e.g.:

## Cleaned, public data <a id="cleaned-data"></a>
I fixed some rough edges in [Citibike's published data][citibike system data] and published the results to [the `ctbk` Amazon S3 bucket][`s3://ctbk`].

Some issues that [`s3://ctbk`] mitigates:
- Convert original CSV's to [Parquet]
  - compressed, column-type-aware format saves some headache
  - works around issues like inconsistent `\n` vs. `\r\n` line endings
- Unzip+Normalize `.zip`s containing CSV's (which are sometimes inconsistently-named or contain erroneous extra files like `.DS_Store` macOS metadata)
- Harmonize column names across months (e.g. `User Type` vs. `usertype`)

## Automatic Updating <a id="auto-update"></a>
On each of the first few days of each month, [a GitHub Action in this repo][github actions]:
- checks [`s3://tripdata`] for a new month of official data
- if found, the new data gets cleaned, converted to [`.parquet`][Parquet], and uploaded to [`s3://ctbk`].

Additionally, aggregated statistics are updated, which the [ctbk.dev] app reads, meaning it should stay up to date as new data is published.

I sometimes break this in the process of adding features and improving things, but it has mostly run automatically each month since â‰ˆ2020.

## Prior Art
[Many][ckran-20210305] [great][toddschneider-20160113] [analyses][jc-analysis-2017] [of][jc-analysis-2018] [Citibike][datastudio-analysis] [data][cl2871-analysis] [have][tableau #citibike] [been][coursera citibike viz course] [done][juanjocarin analysis] over the years. However, I've generally found them lacking in 2 ways:
- They were run once and published, and are now stale. I find them via Google, years later, and want to see the same analysis on the latest data.
- They show a few specific, static plots, but I want to ask slightly different questions of the data, or slice it another way.

My hope is that this dashboard will solve both of these issues, by:
- always staying up to date with the latest published data
- providing 5-10 orthogonal, common-sense toggles that let you easily answer a large number of basic system-level questions

## Implementation
- [ctbk/](./ctbk) contains a Python library that derives various datasets from Citi Bike's public data at [`s3://tripdata`]
- [www/](./www) contains the static web app served at [ctbk.dev].
