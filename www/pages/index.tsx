Historic "rideable type" data is pretty messy:
- "Docked bike" and "classic bike" seem to refer to the same bike type.
- Electric bikes were in widespread use for years before they start showing up in the data here (ca. March 2022).

I'm not sure how real the apparent decline in e-bike use/% is, over 2022.

Several things changed in February 2021 (presumably as part of [the Lyft acquistion](https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/lyft-becomes-americas-largest-bikeshare-service)):
- "Gender" information no longer provided (all rides labeled "unknown" starting February 2021)
- A new "Rideable Type" field was added, containing values \`docked_bike\` and \`electric_bike\` ðŸŽ‰; however, it is mostly incorrect at present, and disabled above:
  - Prior to February 2021, the field is absent (even though e-citibikes were in widespread use before then)
  - Since February 2021, only a tiny number of rides are labeled \`electric_bike\` (122 in April 2021, 148 in May, 113 in June); this is certainly not accurate!
    - One possible explanation: [electric citibikes were launched in Jersey City and Hoboken around April 2021](https://www.hobokengirl.com/hoboken-jersey-city-citi-bike-share-program/); perhaps those bikes were part of a new fleet that show up as \`electric_bike\` in the data (while extant NYC e-citibikes don't).
    - These \`electric_bike\` rides showed up in the default ("NYC") data, not the "JC" data, but it could be all in flux; February through April 2021 were also updated when the May 2021 data release happened in early June.
- The "User Type" values changed ("Subscriber" â†’ "member", "Customer" â†’ "casual"); I'm using the former/old values here, they seem equivalent.
